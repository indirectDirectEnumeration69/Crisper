# Crisper
Sub Project of a hopefully easy to use command line for multi user purposes.

- Start DateðŸ•™: 30/06/2023.

-  Status: Compiles and works correctly.

- Organising into payloads for specific use cases operating systems , web browsers , specific enviroments.

- Creating branches for experimentation. 
- My other project ideas and repos will be integrated into this project.
- Need to start mapping control flow.
- polished threads handling user input , adding server commands.

RoadMap (Currently not in order needs further details) :
  1.  Finish and refine server logic.
  2.  Add server commands.
  3.  Integrate further thread handling.
  4.  Add additional needed libraries.
  5.  Add dependency check functionality , automate some dependencies.
  6.  Finish validation and make it dynamic , integrate hash encryption.
  7.  Structure Files.
  8.  Setup Database.
  9.  Add Neural network integration.

Neural network model variants being considered (matlabs , API's)

==============HYBRID VARIANTS===============

Hybrid models is where i will integrate multiple layers of different models as well as encoding techniques , decoding , back prop + calibration.
Additionally ill list each hybrid model being considered after inital models are documented and testing has began.

FORMS OF NEURAL NETWORKS:

- Machine Translation(trained on large data sets) : for user input.

- Image Processing(Process large sets of image based data) : for enhanced accuracy of target enviroment + additional infomation.

- LSTM VARIANTS (sequential data) : for processing request times , response analysis (signal processing) , pattern recognition of enviroment behaviour.

ISSUES REGARDING PROCESSING POWER AND NEURAL NETWORK CLOUD HOSTING (Future concerns)


- before the botnet is eventually made and operational, drawing and utilizing processing power and efficency is of upmost importance 

- will need additional road map for this.

-Neural network Obfuscated hosting and interaction:


-----------------------------
As i understand neural networks are rather complex they will require additional sub road maps during this project.
