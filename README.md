# Crisper
Sub Project of a hopefully easy to use command line for multi user purposes.

- Start DateðŸ•™: 30/06/2023.

-  Status: Compiles and works correctly - working on server commands now - adding user help module - also now beginning neural networks will do further testing and training locally however will take some time.

-----------

Matlabs Notes:

sentimental analysis training and preprocessing is finished, preprocessing for NMT is finished however needs further optimisation as matlabs doesnt support sequence to sequence machine translation training i am currently making custom batching and training loops as well as custom sequence classification layers etc.

sentiment analysis training :


------------------





- Organising into payloads for specific use cases operating systems , web browsers , specific environments.

- This is a long term project im constantly working on when i can, at the moment im using matlabs to gather the results for assessing what models will be efficent for each task i will be applying each model's use case for.

- end date is unknown however during my free time this project will constantly be expanded upon till its good enough for others to contribute upon my inital ideas and implementation.

- Creating branches for experimentation. 
- My other project ideas and repos will be integrated into this project.
- Need to start mapping control flow and organise files.
- polished threads handling user input , adding server commands.


- Useful note worth exploring in my journey of this project would also be advancements in hearing aids / hearing assistance through the use of neural networks in exploring and achieving natural sound for those with hearing impairments which would garner a side project when i come to explore this side topic in relation to consumer accessible hearing devices with neural calibration or other ideas involving neural networks in audio translation , i understand this already exists however i wish to also explore this topic of interest and try and contribute to this area of development.
- possibly could try to find better ways to reduce costs throughout the manufacturing process with more efficient techniques and further pursuit of incorporating ai and technological advancements.

Goals
-----

- make extensive server commands work correctly.
- make commands use polymorphism instead of the dirty if chain.
- leading onto oop optimisation of commands for easier maintainability and scalability.

RoadMap (Currently not in order needs further details) :
  1.  Finish and refine server logic.
  2.  Add server commands.
  3.  Integrate further thread handling.
  4.  Add additional needed libraries.
  5.  Add dependency check functionality , automate some dependencies.
  6.  Finish validation and make it dynamic , integrate hash encryption.
  7.  Structure Files.
  8.  Setup Database.
  9.  Add Neural network integration.

==============HYBRID VARIANTS===============

Hybrid models is where i will integrate multiple layers of different models as well as encoding techniques , decoding , back prop + calibration.
Additionally ill list each hybrid model being considered after inital models are documented and testing has began.

FORMS OF NEURAL NETWORKS:

I am aware that machine translation accuracy for non latin language sets is biased and inaccurate especially chinese and japenese characters and understanding/interpretation of meaning , meaning through word2vec tokenization etc. 

- Machine Translation(trained on large data sets) : for user input , language corpus sets for universal use based on users language.

- Image Processing(Process large sets of image based data) : for enhanced accuracy of target enviroment + additional infomation.

- LSTM VARIANTS (sequential data) : for processing request times , response analysis (signal processing) , pattern recognition of enviroment behaviour.

ISSUES REGARDING PROCESSING POWER AND NEURAL NETWORK CLOUD HOSTING (Future concerns)


- Google cloud hosting?
- before the botnet is eventually made and operational, drawing and utilizing processing power and efficency is of upmost importance 

- will need additional road map for this.

- Neural network Obfuscated hosting and interaction:


-----------------------------
As i understand neural networks are rather complex they will require additional sub road maps during this project.
