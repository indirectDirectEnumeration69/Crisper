# Crisper
Sub Project of a hopefully easy to use command line for multi user purposes.

- Start DateðŸ•™: 30/06/2023.

-  Status: Compiles and works correctly.

- Organising into payloads for specific use cases operating systems , web browsers , specific enviroments.

- Creating branches for experimentation. 
- My other project ideas and repos will be integrated into this project.
- Need to start mapping control flow.
- polished threads handling user input , adding server commands.

RoadMap (Currently not in order needs further details) :
  1.  Finish and refine server logic.
  2.  Add server commands.
  3.  Integrate further thread handling.
  4.  Add additional needed libraries.
  5.  Add dependency check functionality , automate some dependencies.
  6.  Finish validation and make it dynamic , integrate hash encryption.
  7.  Structure Files.
  8.  Setup Database.
  9.  Add Neural network integration.
  10.

- 1. Work status (meaning when ill specifically be actively working on this project) : Current.

--------
Neural network model variants being considered
--
Reasons for each variant (pros & cons) :

- CNNs: 

- 1. Details:
- 2. Pros + Use Case:
- 3. Cons + possible draw backs of use :

FORMS OF NEURAL NETWORKS:

-Machine Translation(trained on large data sets) : for user input.

- Image Processing(Process large sets of image based data) : for enhanced accuracy of target enviroment + additional infomation.

- LSTM VARIANTS (sequential data) : for processing request times , response analysis (signal processing) , pattern recognition of enviroment behaviour.

---------------
Dependencies
----
- C++ version : std 14
---------------
Debug Analysis:
---
- Control Flow: [] -> -> -> -> []

- Unexpected Behaviour:
-----------
Licenses

- Being decided will be updated at a later date.
